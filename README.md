# WarzoneMapDB

The purpose of this repository is to gather and prepare all good Warzone 2100 maps for inclusion with the next release. 

To use these maps, copy and paste the contents of the map directory into Warzone's mp/multiplay/maps directory. Then replace the addon.lev in Warzone's mp directory.

The output format of the maps (.ini) needs converting to .json before a map can be included with the game. wz_map_parser.py accepts a directory of maps and performs the necessary conversion with author extraction.

If you are an author and would like to modify your map or author name then please let me know.
